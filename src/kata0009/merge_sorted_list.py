Given two integer lists sorted in ascending order, `nums1` and `nums2`, and two integers, `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements to be used from the beginnings of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively, merge the two lists into a single list sorted in ascending order. `nums1` is assumed to have a length of m + n, and the final sorted list should be produced by modifying `nums1` in place, not by returning a new list.
